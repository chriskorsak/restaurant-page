## Description

This restaurant page application is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page) full-stack Javascript course. It notably uses javascript modules for each site _tab/page_. All of the separate javascript modules are bundled together into a single distribution file using an NPM package called _Webpack_.

Additionally, all photography in this project is my own from previous food photography assignments as a commercial photographer.
